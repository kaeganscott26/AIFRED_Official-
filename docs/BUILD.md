# Official build

Use [README commands/prerequisites](../README.md). Canonical entry: `pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/windows/build.ps1 -Action release`. Actions configure/build/test/stage/package/release share incremental out/windows-x64/build. Stage/package assemble and verify without promotion; release promotes after validation.

Exact compiler VST3: `out/windows-x64/build/Aifred_artefacts/Release/VST3/Aifred.vst3`. Exact current: `out/windows-x64/current/Aifred.vst3`. Never select a recursive first-match artifact.

.NET outputs use Directory.Build.props under the canonical platform build root. Host publish includes executable, DLL, runtime configuration and channel.json. Building does not install or launch a plugin.

macOS arm64/Linux x64 presets and configure/build scripts are SCAFFOLDED / NOT VALIDATED. Their distribution/install/promotion workflows are unvalidated.
