# AIFRED Admin App Use Guide

## Login

The admin app supports offline login. Use the configured North3rnLight3r admin username and password. When the phone has no network, the app creates a local admin session so the command tab can run commands inside the Android app sandbox.

Online login uses `https://www.north3rnlight3r.com/api/v1/admin/login` and returns a 24-hour session token. Offline login returns a `local-admin-*` session token.

## Chat

The Chat tab loads the beat catalog from the live website and connects to:

`wss://www.north3rnlight3r.com/ws/chat`

If WebSocket is unavailable, the app falls back to:

`https://www.north3rnlight3r.com/api/v1/chat/ask`

Cloudflare Pages must have `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` configured for model answers. Without either setting, the route still responds but tells you the model provider is not configured.

Direct provider mode is also supported at build time.

OpenAI direct mode:

`.\gradlew.bat assembleDebug -PAIFRED_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1 -PAIFRED_API_TOKEN=<OPENAI_KEY>`

Ollama direct mode:

`.\gradlew.bat assembleDebug -PAIFRED_BASE_URL=http://<LAN-IP>:11434`

Use the workstation LAN IP for Ollama. Do not use `localhost` from the phone unless Ollama is running on the phone.

## Beat Catalog

The app reads:

`https://www.north3rnlight3r.com/api/v1/catalog/list`

Use `Refresh Catalog` in the Chat tab to reload the website catalog. Select a beat to stream it from the site and view the live playback visualizer.

## Upload

The Upload tab can select local Android files and send them to configured admin API routes.

Catalog audio uses:

`POST /api/v1/admin/catalog/upload`

Reference audio uses:

`POST /api/v1/admin/reference/upload`

Website assets use:

`POST /api/v1/admin/files/upload`

Those upload routes commit to the private GitHub repo when `GITHUB_TOKEN` is configured in Cloudflare Pages.

## Command Tab

The command line has two modes.

Online admin session:

Commands are sent to `POST /api/v1/command/run`. The website backend only accepts safe allowlisted commands.

Offline local admin session:

Commands run through Android `sh -c` inside the app runtime environment. This is sandboxed by Android and does not provide root.

## Online Commands

`health`

Checks the live website API.

`catalog:list`

Returns the number of beat catalog tracks.

`models:list`

Shows whether OpenAI and Ollama routes are configured.

`reference:stats`

Shows whether accepted analyzer metadata can persist to the reference pool.

`deploy:status`

Shows the production website domains.

`deploy:site`

Dispatches GitHub Actions workflow `build.yml` when `GITHUB_TOKEN` is configured in Cloudflare Pages.

## Local Android Shell Commands

These work after offline admin login:

`pwd`

Shows the app process working directory.

`ls`

Lists the current app runtime directory.

`ls /sdcard`

Lists shared storage if Android permissions allow it.

`id`

Shows the Android Linux user assigned to the app.

`getprop ro.build.version.release`

Shows the Android OS version.

`df -h`

Shows filesystem capacity.

`pm list packages`

Lists installed Android packages visible to the app.

`input keyevent 3`

Sends the Android home key event if allowed by the runtime.

## Website File Control

Read deployed static files works without GitHub token for files that exist on the public site.

Write/update website files requires Cloudflare Pages environment variable:

`GITHUB_TOKEN`

The token needs repo contents write permission for `kaeganscott26/AIFRED`. When configured, `Save File` commits the edit to GitHub. GitHub Actions or the Cloudflare Pages Git integration then deploys the change.

## Website Analyzer

The public site now has a free browser analyzer. It decodes the uploaded mix locally, draws the visualizer, calculates tone balance, loudness, peak, crest factor, stereo width, low-end control, and harshness control, then sends metadata only to:

`POST /api/v1/analysis/submit`

Passing metadata can be stored when `AIFRED_REFERENCE_POOL` KV is bound. Failing metadata is disposed by the backend response.
